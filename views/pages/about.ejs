        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am an Electronics Engineer graduated from the Universidad El Bosque de Colombia, confident in my handling of telecommunications issues and programming languages. I use a wide variety of creative solutions for unfamiliar problems, and I am always looking for better and optimal ways to approach any topic. I have experience in CISCO network architecture having worked as a configuration engineer for Claro Colombia through a service provision contract from the company ARCOM. As a graphic designer at A more S.A.S., I started the creative process of the corporate image, including the design of the company's brand, logo, website, and image on social networks. I worked hand in hand with architects and civil engineers to prepare proposals for 3D design and editing. My diverse experiences have made me a versatile person who is highly adaptable and eager to learn.
